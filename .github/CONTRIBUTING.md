Welcome! Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Discord WoW Armory Bot project. Before you start writing code please post an issue on Github with your idea so it can be disucssed. Once discussed please fork the repository and open a pull request with your feature, code should be commented and tested.

## Scope
There are a few key points to keep in mind when it comes to the scope of this project.

* Only data which is surfaced in official Blizzard API's should be surfaced. Maintaining multiple third party API's can be a bit of a hassle.
* Only data which is relevent to the current expansion should be added to the bot. This means that Legion raids shouldn't be added when BFA comes out, etc.
