| `WOW_REGION`  | The server region you'd like to query, for example `us`, or `eu`.  |
| `LOCALE`  | The language for your selected WoW region, for example `en_US`, or `en_GB`. Locale depends on region. Please refer to the [Blizzard API documents](https://dev.battle.net/) for more information. At this time this bot will only return data in English.   |

## FAQ :speech_balloon: 
Here's a list of frequently asked questions.
```
Q: Why does it show that my alt has completed an achievement?
A: Some achievements are account wide so the API response for your alt will be the same as your main.

Q: Do you plan on supporting Mythic+ scores?
A: Only if the official Blizzard API begins supporting their own metric.

Q: Why don't you show this raid?
A: I aim to support the most recent raids in the current expansion. Because Discord has a character limit I will start trimming the oldest raid in the current expansion if necessary.

Q: What expansion does this bot currently support?
A: Battle for Azeroth.
